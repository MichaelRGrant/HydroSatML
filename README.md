## Overview

Soil moisture is an important characteristic in agriculture as it has been shown to correlate strongly with plant health and crop yields. However, accurate soil moisture readings are expensive and impractical for capturing high-resolution variability in soil moisture at scale. Remote sensing (e.g. satellite imagery) offers a potential low-cost solution.

Our objective was to determine whether machine learning models can be used to accurately estimate soil moisture with high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery, physical characteristics and environmental factors.
